# Rust::from(lang)

If you've started to learn Rust and you've come from another language
you're strong in it can feel foreign or different. For some it's the
borrow checker, for others it's trying to apply OOP to things you
wouldn't in Rust, or maybe you make sure to check for `null`/`nil`/`undefined`
in other languages but `Option` seems foreign in comparison.
That's where this project comes into play. If you look in the directory
of the language you're familiar with you'll find various Rust concepts
explained in the language you know and how that translates to Rust.

## Contributing
Are you a more seasoned Rust Lang user? Help write some articles for
languages you're also passionate about! Noticed an error? Open up an
issue or a PR so it can get fixed! Felt like the explanation of
something could be better? Open up an issue and let us know how!

There's many ways you can contribute no matter how small a change or
issue. This is a project to help spread love and knowledge of Rust in
accordance with the community's 2017 goals of
[having a lower learning curve](https://github.com/aturon/rfcs/blob/roadmap-2017/text/0000-roadmap-2017.md#rust-should-have-a-lower-learning-curve).

### Opening an Issue
Before you open up an issue please check the issue tracker to make sure your
issue is not already in there. If it's a duplicate the correct issue
will be linked and your issue closed.

### Writing an Article
You can take a look at the [first article](./Haskell/using-result.md)
written for an example of what the format is. In that article it shows
you how to use the `Result` if you are coming from Haskell. Each article
follows a basic format:

1. The Rust concept and what it solves is introduced
2. The problem solved by the Rust concept is answered here with
   an example from the language the user is coming from.
3. The same example is then solved with Rust utilizing the concept
   introduced before.
4. The strengths and weakness of how Rust does it compared to the other
   language is then discussed.

It's a simple format that allows for comparisons between Rust and other
languages. It also allows critical evaluation of problems that might occur
while transitioning from a language to Rust. The code examples given
also provide a spring board for new users to translate code they might
have in another language as practice in using Rust.
